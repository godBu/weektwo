    <p id="quote">"I do not fear computers, I fear lack of them" - Isaac Asimov</p>

    <h3 id="C1">OVERVIEW</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">According to Accenture(2014), 71% of companies saw the IT department as the main harbinger of innovation and development within itself. Like Isaac Asimov, companies started to metaphorically "fear the lack of computers" in the sense that they are
      focused on closing the digital skills gap at an alarming rate. As of 2016, the number of companies that saw the IT department as the sole precursor of technological change was reduced to 34%. Why did this happen, you might ask? This is all down
      to the flexibility and adaptablity of the modern IT personnel who is able to bring about change in any department they find themselves not just the IT one, that is to say, the modern IT personnel is a doctor and a software tester or an engineer
      and a software developer. This new multifaceted face of IT is the reason why employees can now create change across all levels of an organization </p>

    <h3 id="C3">METHODS, SKILLS AND RESOURCES</h3>
    <h4 id="C3a">METHODS</h4>
    <p class="paragraph">There are various ways of managing digital projects for example scrum, kanban, waterfall to name a few. It is important to note that the success of either one of the methodologies mentioned above depends on the team and nature of project as none of
      them is the de facto best. With an in-depth analysis it is clear to see that all these methods seem to contain five important factors
      <h4 id="C3ai">Scoping</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">The brainstorming phase of the operation. The meeting involves key stakeholders, clients and a team and the goal is to establish scope, milestones and task allocation.
        <h4 id="C3aii">Planning</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">This involves actually conceptualization the scoping phase of a project. This creative process involves communication amongst key stakeholders and various teams like UX, Design, Marketing and Development in order to produce what the client has
          in mind. It involves using pseudocode and flowcharts to give skeleton to the project</p>
        <h4 id="C3aiii">Development</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">This is the stage at which the project develops from back-end to front-end, securing the project's foundation before giving it its appearance. Using pacakges like PHP, Python and Java for backend development and HTML, CSS and Javascript for frontend
          development. This stage involves alpha and beta rollouts to accomodate revisions before final deployment</p>
        <h4 id="C3aiv">Testing & Deployment</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">This is the immersive testing phase that ensures final product is QA approved and then deployment. At this stage various uses-test are carried out to ensure that functions and specifications are spot-on before product goes live</p>
        <h4 id="C3av">Maintenance</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">After delivering product, it now goes into maintenance phase. This is a continuous phase that seeks to improve functionality, fix bugs, addresses stability issues and offers support to end-users.</p>
        <h4 id="C3b">RESOURCES</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">The resources utilized during the course of a digital project are listed below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Trello - This is an online tool that enables a team scope and plan a project. It allows for organizing tasks into Things To Be Done, Doing and Done which in turn allows for easy workflow from start to completion
            <li>Notes - This is a desktop tool that enables a team expand on the scope and plans. On Notes, your developers begin writing pseudocode required for full stack development
              <li>VS Code - This is a free and open source code editor that is used for compiling and debugging modern applications </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="C3c">SKILLS</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">Example of the skills needed are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Time Management - This is a fundamental skill required for any project. A good scope and plan on trello is essential in allocating the labour and time-constraints of a project at hand
            <li>Agile Methodology - This is the best method to developing a software because it works continuously and iteratively, and because it is a consistent loop, it helps the team combat unpredictable elements and adapt the project</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="C4">RISKS</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">Some of the risks associated with digital projects include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rolling out an app initially with all the necessary functionalities is way better than releasing an app with features and innovations that end-users might not be open to. It is safe to release an app initially, collect and collate feedback and
            then update as clients and end-users dictate
            <li>Having the right amount of highly engaging people working on a project is way better than having a lot of people as this leads to chaos and little decision making. Also, it is important to have a focal department that everybody else can report
              to because it is better when instructions are coming from a sole source
              <li>Upskilling the organization is way better than staying stagnant as an organization. Upskilling reduces the possibility of risks affecting future projects and helps in innovation and optimizing already-made products on the market
                <li>Having continuous product support for all released products is way better than having no support at all</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="C5">LEGAL CONSTRAINTS AND GUIDELINES</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">In order for the app to function in the real world, it has got to go through a series of compliance tests. Compliance to laws and regulations, privacy terms, financial and technological cooperation as well as secure storage of client information. The impact of GDPR on digital projects is urging us as developers to seek permission from client before accepting their data and to make sure we are completely compliant about what we want to do with it, how we choose to store and access it.

    <h3 id="C6">REVIEW</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">The ongoing tools available to me, as described under the RESOURCES section, are capable of rendering a digital project to its completion</p>   Trello was quintessential in keeping me time conscious as well as organizing my objectives during the scoping and planning phases of the website.
VS Code was the IDE of my choice during the development phase of my project, writing and compiling code. The only problem that I encountered with VS Code during the course of the project was the fact that I had to constantly and consistently revert from web browser to software package and vice versa in order to know what my website looked like.
Codepen proved better suited for my project that vs code seeing as I was able to view my website in real time as I wrote and compiled code. Codepen also allowed me to work with html, css and javascript without switching tabs.
